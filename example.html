            <h1>The amazing adventures of Little Timmy</h1>
            <h2>City of the honest bandits</h2>
            <h3>Hot food</h3>
            <p><strong>Little Timmy</strong> aproached the tavern keeper with a handful of gold coins hard earned in the streets a couple of nights back, when those two drunk adventurers fell to the ground right in front of him. They were too wasted to notice how a couple of old rusty coins slippered from their bag into the wet and cold stone of the city streets before they keep in their way, giving <strong>little Timmy</strong> its first hot meal since the last lunar cycle.</p>
            <p>Picking up the coins was not the hard part but rather keeping them hidden while a bunch of guards stormed through a nearby corner past the boy, <a class="tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="">weapons</a> drawn and <a class="tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="">all</a>, right after the drunk adventurers.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Little Timmy: </strong>Give me one of your finest meals, good folk. To night I'm celebrating something important.</p>
                <p><strong>Bartender: </strong>Take a look at what I have on offer tonight.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Meal</th>
                    <th>Cost</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Roasted Chicken</td>
                    <td>10 gp</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hot Drak</td>
                    <td>100 gp</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hag Soup</td>
                    <td>2 sp</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>And so, Little Timmy had to chose from the many delicous meals he was presented. He had never seen so much food together, and so his mind dreamed of what other foods ha had been missing his entery life.</p>
            <p>What if Little Timmy could become a knight, have it's own castle and be served whatever food he fancied? That seemed like a life Little Timmy would like, and so, he orderer the cheapest food (for now) and set foot in an adventur that would get his dream a bit closer.</p>
